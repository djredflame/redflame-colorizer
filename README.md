# Redflame Colorizer 🎛🔥

Redflame Colorizer is a minimal and powerful Max for Live device for Ableton Live that automatically assigns colors to your tracks based on instrument types.

## 🎯 What It Does

When you drop the device into your Live Set, it immediately scans all existing tracks and applies a color scheme based on their names. For example:

- `kick`, `snare`, `perc` → red
- `bass`, `sub` → green
- `synth`, `lead` → blue
- `piano`, `keys` → white
- `guitar`, `cello`, `violin` → brown
- `vocal`, `voice` → orange
- `fx`, `sfx`, `risers` → dark gray

The mapping is customizable in the source code.

## ✅ How to Use

1. Open your Ableton Live set.
2. Drag the `Redflame Colorizer.amxd` device into main track.
3. Boom — track names are analyzed and colored automatically.
4. Rename any track — the color will update instantly.

## 🧠 Why Use This?

- Better visual overview of your session
- Instant recognition of track types
- Save time on manual coloring
- Works with your own naming conventions

## 💡 Customization

Want to change colors or extend the mappings? Open the `colorize.ts` file and edit the `colorMap` dictionary.
